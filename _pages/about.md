My name is XUEQIANG LU (鲁学强), and I was born in 1994 in Luzhou, Sichuan Province, China. In 2017, I earned my bachelor's degree from the School of Geoscience and Technology at Southwest Petroleum University (SWPU). Following my graduation, I passed the National Master's Degree Admission Examination in 2018 and was admitted to the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), specifically, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment (IMHE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). After two years, I transitioned from a Master's program directly into Ph.D. under the supervision of Professor Gordon G.D. ZHOU. As of 2024, I am set to graduate in June with a Ph.D. in Geotechnical Engineering.

I am doing research on the mechanisms of breaching in landslide/moraine dams and the resulting outburst floods. I have designed a custom instrumented flume capable of monitoring dynamic (via force plate) and seismic (using geophones) signals during dam breaching and outburst flooding events. My expertise encompasse both experimental research and numerical simulations (utilizing depth-averaged continuum models, OlaFOAM or OpenFOAM).

Throughout my Ph.D. program, I have published a total of 6 journal papers, with 4 of which in TOP journals. I have served as the first author or corresponding author on 2 of these publications. Collectively, these papers have garnered google scholar <a style="display: none;" href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YOUR_GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID&user=Bg80K9YAAAAJ'><strong><span id='total_cit'></span></strong> google scholar citations </a> <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YOUR_GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID&user=Bg80K9YAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

[Mechanisms of the Non-Uniform Breach Morphology Evolution of Landslide Dams Composed of Unconsolidated Sediments During Overtopping Failure](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JF006664) **[JGR: Earth Surface, IF5= 4.5]** 👉 [[Google Scholar]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Bg80K9YAAAAJ&citation_for_view=Bg80K9YAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='Bg80K9YAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C'></span></strong> 📊

Gordon G.D. ZHOU, **Xueqiang LU***, Yunxu XIE, Kahlil F. E. CUI, and Hui TANG

**Highlights**
- Erosion along dam surfaces varies non-uniformly in both vertical and lateral directions;
- The non-uniform breach morphology evolution promotes a positive feedback between the breach flow velocity and dam surface gradients;
- The gradual saturation of the breach flow with sediment influences the non-uniform breach morphology evolution of breaching landslide dams.

**Xueqiang LU**, Gordon G.D. ZHOU*, Kahlil F. E. CUI, Hui TANG, and Yunxu XIE

**Highlights** 
- A quantitative relationship between the runup and overtopping volume of solitary waves is newly established;
- A novel overtopping equation, developed from geometric arguments, captures its dependence on the wave and dam properties;
- An empirical method relating the wave and dam properties to the outburst flood volume is proposed.
